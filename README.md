- Iâ€™m currently working as Senior Tech Communication Officer [@PagoPA](https://github.com/pagopa)
- Pronouns: [he/him/his](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/he/him/his/his/himself)

I come from an **information architecture**, **interaction design** and **project management** background, mostly in streaming video web projects. Now I'm Senior Tech Communication @PagoPA (Italy). I spent all my work life in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. 

I love travelling with my gravel bike, and playing rock blues with my Fender Stratocaster. Most importantly, I'm a father.
