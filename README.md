### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**biccio/biccio** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Seionr Tech Communication Officer [@PagoPA](https://github.com/pagopa)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Co-founder of [Vudio](https://vudio.it)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

I come from an **information architecture**, **interaction design** and **process design** background, mostly in streaming video web projects. Now I'm co-founder @Vudio, and Senior Tech Communication @PagoPA (Italy). I spent all my work life in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. 

I love travelling with my gravel bike, and playing rock blues with my Fender Stratocaster. Most importantly, I'm a father.
