- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Tech Communication Lead [@PagoPA](https://github.com/pagopa)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Co-founder of [Vudio](https://vudio.it)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

I come from an information architecture, interaction design and process design background, mostly in streaming video web projects. Now I'm co-founder @Vudio, and Lead Tech Communication @PagoPA (Italy). I spent all my work life explaining and simplifying digital complexities. I love travelling with my gravel bike, and playing rock blues with my Fender Stratocaster. Most importantly, I'm a father of a 5 month old newborn.
